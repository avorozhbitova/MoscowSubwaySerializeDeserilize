# MoscowSubwaySerializeDeserilize

Hello there!

This is one of my tasks at skillbox.ru.

The task was to learn how to parse data from HTML pages, create and read JSON files. 

It's needed to:

- parse the HTML code of the Moscow subway
- create a JSON file with all stations, lines, and connections
- read this JSON file and count the number of stations on each line and the number of connections

The list of used instruments is below:

- Maven
- jsoup
- gson
